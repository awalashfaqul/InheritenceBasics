# InheritenceBasics
Writing this program, as a part of managing a Zoo, tried to create new animals, with the usage of one step inheritence and also two-step inheritence. Also created their own special properties, special methods to access them from other classes. 

For example, here I have created new animals like Lion and Tiger, directly inherited from Animal class, sharing the common properties of animals and also having their own special properties. This is an example of one step inheritence.

On the other hand, when I  have created a Bengal Tiger and a White Tiger, they are inherited from the Tiger and Tiger is inherited from the Animal. So this is an example of two-step inheritence in this program.

And this is what I have learned while coding for this inheritence practice using animal as examples. This will also help me to grow my skills and interest to inheritence other than animal as well.
